However, all too often this approach leads to false conclusions.

Throughmany generations of reproduction and survival (natural selection), trees species have evolved intomosaics of populations each adapted to environmental conditions. Variation in climate and day lengthare primary abiotic drivers of natural selection in plants. Whenever there is variation in theenvironment, there is genetic variation in the species. We use a wide range of plant characteristics, suchas mortality, growth rate, morphology, phenology, physiological attributes and molecular signatures toreveal the size and pattern of genetic variation in the species. Planting and managing trees is the mostefficient and fastest way to grow wood fibre for the lumber and pulp industry. As opposed to naturalregeneration, planting and managing trees accelerates growth to produce wood fibre at a shorterrotation. However, through the choice and use of seed, planting trees carries a risk of altering thebalance between trees and their environment. Use of wrong seed source will adversely affects thehealth and productivity of the forest on which the forestry industry depends. The basic theme of thisseminar is “why we select seed sources in forestry”. It is designed to provide in plain language andsimple illustrations, the biological evidence of population genetic variation in forest trees, and theapplication of this knowledge to reforestation. All illustrations are based on Alberta conifer speciesprovenance trials and tree breeding programs. The seminar will benefit practicing foresters, biologistsand anybody who plant forest trees for commercial purposes and reclamation.",
